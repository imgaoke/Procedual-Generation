This is a repository providing an introduction to answer set programming (ASP). It requires clingo
(https://potassco.org/clingo/). It contains a simplified Python binding for clingo and a handful of examples.


### Prerequisites

Clingo (https://potassco.org/clingo/). Obtainable through pip / conda.


## Simple Python binding

This is provided by ```simple_clingo.py```. For example usage, check ```simple_example.py```. 

## Examples

Additional examples of answer set programs are provided (ordered by ASP program complexity):

 - Reasoning about wet grass
    - ```examples/0_sprinklers.lp```
 - Graph coloring
    - ```examples/1_graph_coloring.lp```
 - Finding hamiltionian cycles in oriented graphs
    - ```examples/2_hamiltonian_cycles.lp```
 - A text-based murder mystery game with plot generated by ASP
    - ```murder_mystery_text.py```
    - ```examples/3_murder_mystery.lp```
 - Sudoku solver
    - ```sudoku_solver.py```
    - ```examples/4_sudoku_solver.lp```
 - Maze generator
    - ```maze_generator.py```
    - ```examples/5_maze.lp```
 - Sudoku generator
    - ```sudoku_generator.py```
    - ```examples/sudoku_generator.lp```
    - (utilizes sudoku solver)
