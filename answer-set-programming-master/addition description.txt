Not everybody has a good memory except murderer. So the people who are not the murderer might not remember who he/she saw in the room he/she was in.
The murderer will tell a different room than the murder room and will claim to have seen the person in the room that he claims to be in.
So asking the person who the murdurer claims to be with or the person who was in the murderer room about who did they see might not work.

How to ensure a single possible logical deduction?
The victim has relationships with 3 other people. Let's say the 3 people are A,B and C.
Let's say B is the murderer. B knows that the victim has relationships with A and C so he/she commit the crime.
But A only knows the victim has a relationship with C and C only knows the victim has a relationship with A.
So A and C will try to suspect each other. And B will frame A or C for commiting the crime.
Therefore the person who is not getting suspected but suspecting some other person is the murderer.
